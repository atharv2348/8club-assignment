# 8Club Assignment

In this project, 
- To effectively manage the app's state, I primarily used the GetX state management library.
- The project structure was maintained by separating screens, models, controllers, services, and utils (constant parameters).
- I used the cached network image package to load the images from an API, which allows the images to be cached and not reloaded repeatedly.
- I used the camera, audio_waveforms, and patg_provider packages to create audio and video recordings.
